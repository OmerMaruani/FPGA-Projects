# FPGA-Projects

**This repository contains Verilog implementations of various digital systems, demonstrating key concepts in digital logic design, including shifting lights, stopwatch functionality, and matrix multiplication. The projects are developed using both Verilog and VHDL, and are simulated in ModelSim.**

### Project Files

- **src**: Contains the main Verilog code for the light shifting logic.
- **sim**: Contains the testbenches and simulation files for ModelSim/Questa to verify the design.
- **par**: The place and route files used to implement the design on FPGA hardware.
