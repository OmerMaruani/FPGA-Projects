# FPGA-Projects

**This repository contains Verilog implementations of various digital systems, demonstrating key concepts in digital logic design, including shifting lights, stopwatch functionality, and matrix multiplication. The projects are developed using both Verilog and VHDL, and are simulated in ModelSim.**
